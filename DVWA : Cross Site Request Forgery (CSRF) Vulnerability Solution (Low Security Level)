-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DVWA User Credentials - 

Victim Credentials - 	pablo		letmein

Attacker Credentials -	1337		charley

This is low security level challenge, where password is going in URL as parameter.

1. Login as victim i.e. "pablo" to confirm current user credentials.
2. Logout from the application and now login as attacker i.e. "1337"
3. Go to CSRF challenge tab
4. Set password for attacker account as newpwd
5. Copy the URL after password change - http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=newpwd&password_conf=newpwd&Change=Change#
6. We can notice new password and confirm password going in URL
7. Now login as victim i.e. "pablo"
8. If attacker can share the password change URL by mail or by any link and if victim load the URL while logged in to that particular application then CSRF can be possible.
9. Lets try to load the URL where victim is logged in
10. We received Password Changed. message
11. Now logout and try to login with old password
12. Login failed.
13. Try the new password which was set by the attacker i.e. newpwd
14. CSRF is possible where password is going in URL as parameter without any protection
15. Challenge Solved..
