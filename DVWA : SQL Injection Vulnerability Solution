Login to DVWA application and go to SQL Injection challenge
Its asking for User ID:
Lets provide 1
User ID 1 is for admin
Now provide 3
We found a valid user for 3 as well
Now provide any special character such as '
Application throws error for ' and it might be vulnerable to SQL Injection
Now again try other special character %
There is no output for %
Now prepare a payload which results true response i.e. %' or '1'='1
We got all user details using the payload
Now modify the same payload to get False result %' or '1'='2
No output
Hence, application is vulnerable to SQL Injection
Now exploit it further to get sensitive data from the database.
Challenge Solved..
