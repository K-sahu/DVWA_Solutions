Login to DVWA application and go to Blind SQL Injection challenge
Its asking to provide User ID:
Lets provide 1 as User ID
We received response as User ID exists in the database. for User ID 1
Now provide 9 as User ID
For 9, we received response as User ID is MISSING from the database.
Now provide special character '
For ', response is - User ID is MISSING from the database.
So for all invalid data we are getting response as User ID is MISSING from the database
Lets prepare a payload which always return True value i.e. %' or '1'='1
We received response as User ID exists in the database., for %' or '1'='1
now modify the payload, which will return False response %' or '1'='2
Now response is - User ID is MISSING from the database.
Application considered %' or '1'='1, as a valid User ID.
We can conclude application is vulnerable to SQL Injection, though its not disclosing any sensitive data such as SQL error, table name or database name.
We need to plan our attack further to get sensitive data.
Challnge Solved.
